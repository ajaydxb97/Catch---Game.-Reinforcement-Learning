# Catch Game.Reinforcement-Learning
This repository was created by Ajay Balasubramanian and Gaurav Duggal for a Project: Implementation of a Catch game agent using Policy Gradient Methods.

# Requirements:
1) Python 3.6
2) numpy
3) keras
4) tensorflow
5) scipy
6) matplotlib


# Methods used:

1) REINFORCE
2) Actor-Critic
3) Actor-Critic Entropy

# Usage:
All methods have their own py files named after them. It consists of both the training and testing of the agent.
